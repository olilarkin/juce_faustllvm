# LIBFAUST LLVM JIT Module for JUCE

This is a JUCE Module for embedding the libfaust JIT compiler as a JUCE AudioProcessor/AudioPluginInstance. It includes supporting classes such as a Faust syntax highlighter for the JUCE code editor.

Only works on macOS for now, but eventually should work on Linux and Windows

See example CLI project https://github.com/olilarkin/juce_faustllvm_test

# License

The core of this module is heavily based on the faustgen~ Max external by GRAME.
